# javascript-challenge
This is homework 14 for Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp at the University of Minnesota.

Goal
"...create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values... only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages."

The data it draws on lives in the working directory in the JSON file called HW14_static_data.js.


The dataset is a list of dictionaries:

var data = [{
    datetime: "1/1/2010",
    city: "benton",
    state: "ar",
    country: "us",
    shape: "circle",
    durationMinutes: "5 mins.",
    comments: "4 bright green...my front door."
  },
  {}...
]

Instructions
x "Create a new repository for this project called javascript-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

x "Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Javascript challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2.

x "Add your html files to this folder as well as your static folder containing your javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

x "Push the above changes to GitHub.

OOO "Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file

"Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

x "Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

OOO "Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

OOO "Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

OOO "Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input."
