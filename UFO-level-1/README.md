# javascript-challenge
This is homework 14 based on material covered March 31, April 3, and April 5, 2021 in Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp at the University of Minnesota.

Goal
"...create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values... only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages."

The data it draws on lives in the working directory in the JSON file called HW14_static_data.js.


The dataset is a list of dictionaries:

var data = [{
    datetime: "1/1/2010",
    city: "benton",
    state: "ar",
    country: "us",
    shape: "circle",
    durationMinutes: "5 mins.",
    comments: "4 bright green...my front door."
  },
  {}...
]


The HTML contains

<div class="col-md-10">
          <div id="table-area" class="">
            <table id="ufo-table" class="table table-striped">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th class="table-head">Date</th>
                  <th class="table-head">City</th>
                  <th class="table-head">State</th>
                  <th class="table-head">Country</th>
                  <th class="table-head">Shape</th>
                  <th class="table-head">Duration</th>
                  <th class="table-head">Comments</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody></tbody>
            </table>
          </div>
        </div>

Instructions
x "Create a new repository for this project called javascript-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

x "Push the above changes to GitHub.

OOO "Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file

"Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

x "Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).
